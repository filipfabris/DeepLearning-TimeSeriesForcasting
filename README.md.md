# DeepLearningHomework2

* Course: `ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING`
* Professor: `Prof. Dr. Matteucci Matteo`, `Prof. Dr. Giacomo Boracchi`
* University: `Politecnico di Milano`

## Project Structure:
### 1. Cleaning Data
- Using FastDump clustering, we removed outliers and duplicate images.

### 2. Model Choice
- We tested different models inside `FinalNotebook.ipynb`.
- We found that `Model 12` performs the best.
- His arhitecture: `Conv1D + Bidirectional LSTM + Dense`

## Running Notebook Using Colab
- Inside provided Google Drive link, you can find notebook for each category.
- Finaly each notebook will save its model to \Models folder.
- After than we modified model.py to make an ensemble of all models.

## Link to Dataset
 - You can access the project using Google Drive: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k1-lPkaCEqRbdJLlkcgbZ9P95x2ZA1Nz)
